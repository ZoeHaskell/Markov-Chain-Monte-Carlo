Find a system/model/dataset which I can use to actually try out this approach
I'll need to figure out a reasonable prior distribution for that system/model/dataset
I'm trying to generate samples from the posterior CDF in order to estimate it.

Of the several methods I could use, which will be the most effective and efficient? 
Some options to check include the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Slice sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Exact Sampling

What if anything can I say about this method in terms of how quickly it converges to a 'true' sample from the posterior CDF?

I know rejection of a stochastic step needs to occur roughly 50-60% of the time (ran across an information theory result to that effect, 
but need to look deeper into the details), and to ensure rejections occur, otherwise we're just sampling from the stochastic process in question, not from the distribution.
